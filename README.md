# Kalifix
shell script to fix first installs of Kali
NEW UPDATE: AUTO.sh automates the process below

git clone https://github.com/Khatcode/Automated-Kali-Install-Fix cd Automated-Kali-Install-Fix chmod +x AUTO.sh sudo ./AUTO.sh

Bash File to automatically add Kali Sources.list file to current os

It is a simple script I wrote. It's my first automated script for adding the kali repository to the current os you want use. Updates will be in the future.

to use just

git clone https://github.com/Khatcode/Kali-Linux-Source-Fix cd Kali-Linux-Source-Fix chmod +x kalifix.sh ./kalifix.sh or bash kalifix.sh

there is a shebang that points to the bash interpreter so if you run it without the "bash" it will still run.
